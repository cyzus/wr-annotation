# Event & Graph Annotation Guideline

## 1. Objective

Verify the factual correctness and causal validity of events in the Hindsight Graph. The graph serves as ground truth for evaluating LLM forecasting — its quality must be rigorously validated.

Up to 10 events per question.

---

## 2. What You See Per Event

Each event card shows:

- **Date** — color-coded blue if within the Polymarket market window, gray if before it opened
- **In Market Window / Pre-Market badge** — quick visual indicator
- **Title & Description** — the event as extracted by the Hindsight Agent
- **Source** — link to the original article (if available)
- **Your Expected Impact** — your judgement of whether this event should move the outcome probability up, down, or not at all. The AI's impact analysis is hidden behind an expandable section and should not be treated as the answer.

The sidebar also shows the **market window** (open → close date) and a link to the Polymarket market for in-context verification.

Before annotating events for a question, review the hindsight explanation for at least 20 seconds. Events are then shown one at a time. For each event with a source URL, open and read the source before approving, rejecting, or skipping.

## 3. Decision Framework

For every event, make **two assessments** (in order):

### Step 1 — Event Validity (required for all events)

Ask: *Is this event real, specific, and causally relevant?*

For every rejection, add a short evidence note in the inline form. One concise
sentence is enough. For factual/source problems, also enter the corrected date
or a better source URL if you know one. This keeps approval and rejection effort
balanced and helps distinguish a truly fabricated event from a real event with
a bad link, wrong date, weak causal connection, duplicate coverage, or overly
broad framing.

| Decision | Condition |
|---|---|
| **Approve** | Event happened, the source/date are acceptable, and it has a logical causal link to the forecast outcome |
| **Reject: Fabricated Event** | The event itself appears not to have happened |
| **Reject: Wrong Date** | The event is real, but the displayed date is materially wrong |
| **Reject: Source Mismatch** | The event may be real, but the linked source does not support this title/description |
| **Reject: Prediction / Opinion** | The source is only predicting, speculating, or commenting — not reporting a confirmed occurrence |
| **Reject: Noise** | Event is real but has no meaningful causal connection to the forecast outcome |
| **Reject: Duplicate** | Same occurrence already captured by another event — keep the one with richer detail |
| **Reject: Too Broad** | Describes a multi-month trend or category of events rather than a single, atomic occurrence |
| **Skip: Unverifiable** | Last resort only: cannot verify after checking the source and doing a brief search |

### Step 2 — Expected Impact Direction (only when the impact section is shown)

Ask: *Based on the event and source, how should this event affect the probability of the outcome?*

| Assessment | Condition |
|---|---|
| **Up** | The event should increase the probability of the outcome. |
| **Down** | The event should decrease the probability of the outcome. |
| **None** | The event is valid but should not meaningfully move the outcome probability. |

## 4. Using the Market Window as Evidence

### What "in market window" means
The market window is the period when Polymarket was actively tracking this question. Events are tagged "In Market Window" if their date falls between the market open and `resolution_date`.

- **Market open date**: shown when available (about 1/3 of questions). When absent, an estimated open date is shown — treat it as approximate.
- **Market close date**: always available (`resolution_date`).

### How to use it
For events **within the market window**, the UI shows a mini price chart (pre-fetched from Polymarket). Use it to judge your expected impact direction:

- If the event coincides with a price increase, **Up** may be appropriate.
- If the event coincides with a price decrease, **Down** may be appropriate.
- If price barely moved or the event is only background context, **None** may be appropriate.

For events **before the market opened**, the chart will not cover that date. Judge the causal logic on its own merits.

For **non-Polymarket questions** (no market window or chart shown), assess impact validity based on general causal reasoning alone.

## 5. Annotation Criteria in Detail

### Factual Correctness and Source Quality
- The source article should confirm the event actually occurred.
- **Web Search is Encouraged**: If the source link is broken, missing, weak, or behind a paywall, please perform a quick web search using the event title and date to verify if it happened.
- Dates should match the article's publication date or the event date reported within it.
- If the event is real but the date is wrong, reject as **Wrong Date** and enter the corrected date if available.
- If the event is real but the linked URL does not support it, reject as **Source Mismatch** and enter a better URL if available.
- If the article or your search shows only a *prediction*, *commentary*, *hypothetical*, betting preview, or analyst opinion, reject as **Prediction / Opinion**.
- Use **Fabricated Event** only when the event itself appears false or you cannot find evidence that it happened after a reasonable check.
- Use **Skip** sparingly. A broken link, paywall, weak source, or ambiguous date is usually not enough by itself to skip. If you can determine the event is false, source-mismatched, date-mismatched, irrelevant, duplicated, or too broad, use the corresponding reject label instead.

### Impact Validity
- The event must have a plausible mechanism directly connecting it to the forecast question's outcome.
- Pure background/context events (e.g., "a facility was built in 2014") are not causally proximate unless the question directly depends on that specific historical fact.
- Intermediate causes are valid as long as the causal chain to the outcome is clear and traceable.

### Granularity
- The event must describe a **single, specific occurrence** with an identifiable date.
- **Reject as Too Broad** if it summarizes an ongoing process (e.g., "AI developed rapidly throughout 2023") rather than a discrete action (e.g., "OpenAI released GPT-4 on March 14, 2023").

## 6. Priority for Your Attention

Events are pre-sorted by importance. Spend the most effort on:

1. **Events with an impact section that are inside the market window** — these are the most verifiable and the most consequential for evaluation quality
2. **Events with an impact section outside the window** — impact can still be judged on causal logic
3. **Events without an impact section** — assess validity only; skip the expected-impact step entirely

## 7. Edge Cases

| Situation | Guidance |
|---|---|
| Event has no impact section | Assess validity only; do not mark expected impact |
| Two events describe the same news | Approve the one with more specific date/detail; Reject the other as **Duplicate** |
| Event date is years before the question's market window | Almost always background context — Reject as **Noise** unless the question outcome explicitly depends on that specific historical event |
| Source link is broken or missing | **Perform a quick web search** using the event details. If you find a better source, use **Approve** if the event is relevant or **Source Mismatch** if the original URL is misleading. Only skip if it remains completely unverifiable after a brief search. |
| Source is paywalled | Search for another source or article title first. Use **Source Mismatch** if the visible article metadata does not support the event; use **Skip** only if no verification is possible. |
| Event is true but the source only supports part of it | Reject as **Source Mismatch** if the unsupported part is central; otherwise approve and provide the better source URL. |
| Event is true but the AI's causal explanation is overstated | Approve the event if relevant, then choose your own expected impact direction. Do not reject a real relevant event solely because the AI's reasoning is weak. |
| Market open date shown as "estimated" | Treat the market window boundary as approximate ±2 weeks; don't reject events solely for falling slightly outside an estimated boundary |
